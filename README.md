# Flograppling video manager

Because Flograppling webapp don't manage videos and save view times at all, lets do an extension that can do it !
- Improve the overall view experience 
- Save video times and load videos at the last time viewed
-  Our watch history so we can just click and go to them

Why Flograppling doesn't have these features ? No idea :lol:

For personal use :cowboy_hat_face:
